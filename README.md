# CRUD-Review
My first CRUD web application in which people will judge things

1. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc.)? If so, please list who.
Alex Troupe, Brandon Barron (other class)

2. Did you complete any advanced extensions to this challenge? If so, what?
No, I unfortunately wasn't able to get the basic requirements to work on mine! Going over Parse together in class
helped, but other live updates like upvoting reviews and getting the average rating were aspects I couldn't figure out.
I should have started earlier.

3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge?
I'm guessing 15, I should have started earlier

4. Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better?
The whole plugin thing with the stars was super confusing.
